# BoomPanel BETA - Admin panel for sourcemod
This is admin panel that I have been working on for quite a while, and it is currently in BETA version, but is already usable. Has been tested only on CS:GO, so other game support right now isn't available.

## About BoomPanel

The idea of panel is to provide you features to control your server without beeing ingame or even from mobile, starting from banlist, mute/gags, admin activity and so on. Right now this is in BETA version, so you can expect some bugs
or have some features that are not finished yet, but I do believe some of you could already start using it. 

More info will be added later..
